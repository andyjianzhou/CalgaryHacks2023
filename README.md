CropWatch uses a Machine Learning model in order to understand and analyze crop yield data across various factors such as region, rainfall, previous crop yield patterns, etc and based of the data predicts the crop yield in various regions while highlighting the chances of a food shortage, the supply chain that caused the shortage and the supply chains affected in future. It used AI algorithms and research in order to highlight different food shortages in various supply chains.
